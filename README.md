Balls.py is a program that simulates an animation of balls bouncing around the window and off of each other (using graphics.py library).

<b>NOTE:</b> Requires Python version 3.3.x to work.

How to use:
- Download both Balls.py and graphics.py in the same directory
- Run Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) in the directory where the files are and type `python Balls.py`
- A window should open with a bunch of balls on the screen; click inside the window to make the balls bounce around, click again to close the program
